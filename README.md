Program Description: This is a program that emulates the console project of the same name that we did during the coding combine. It's an API program that takes in a string input from the user, and uses a random number generator to provide a response to the user's question to emulate how a Magic 8-Ball toy works.

Peer Review By: Pedro Castaneda - I like the use of the switch statement and that you can see what question you asked in the postman console. Great work! Your program works well.

How To Instuctions:
1) Load the program into VSCode.
2) Start Debugging.
3) Copy Local Host URL from the console (e.g. "http://localhost:5264")
4) Open Postman program and paste the copied URL into a new workspace, with the "GET" input field.
5) Append the URL with "Magic8BallEndpoint/Magic8Ball/{question}"
6) Replace "{question}" with whatever question the user wishes to ask of the Magic 8-Ball, and hit the "Send" button to the right of the input field.
